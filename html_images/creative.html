    <h1>Creative Thinking</h1>
    <p>Creative thinking is the ability to consider something in a new way. It might be a new approach to a problem, a resolution to a conflict between employees, 
        <br> a new result from a data set.</p>

    <h2>How creative thinking works</h2>
    <p>Opportunities for creative thought in the workplace vary from obvious artistic positions to highly technical ones. Generally, anything that involves an “aha” 
        <br>moment is considered creative. Here are some examples of how to display creative thinking in different jobs.

    </a>Beyond ‘formal’ creative thinking opportunities, there are also things that you can do to help yourself think more creatively on a routine basis.<br>
    Spreading your social wings’ to get to know a wider and more diverse group of people.<br>
    We all tend to get on best with people who are like us, and particularly people with the same background and overall views on life. However, associating with people who are like us tends to mean that our thinking gets a bit ‘lazy’. Our assumptions go unchallenged, and our views tend to get reinforced.<br>
    Taking time to actively go out and meet new people—and particularly more diverse people, who are not so like you—will help you to challenge your assumptions. Without even realising that you are doing so, you will start to think more widely, and see things differently.<br>
